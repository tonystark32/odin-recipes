    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers wide, flat pasta sheets with rich,
         savory fillings. The traditional version consists of multiple layers of pasta,
          a hearty meat sauce (often made with ground beef or pork and simmered in a 
          tomato-based sauce), b√©chamel (a creamy white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk),
        and a generous amount of melted cheese, such as mozzarella and Parmesan. The dish
        is then baked until bubbly and golden brown, creating a deliciously comforting
        and filling meal. Variations may include vegetarian options or different 
        types of cheese, but the basic idea is a delicious combination of flavors and 
        textures.</p>

            <li>1 pack lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound cottage cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
            <li> Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. </li>
            <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
        </ol>
